    Given an array of forcasted maximum temperatures, the thermometer displays a string with these temperatures. 

    Example: [17,21,23] will print"... 17°C in 1 days... 21°C in 2 days ... 23°C in 2 days .. 23°C in 3 days..."
    
    Create a function "printForecast" which takes in an array 'arr' and logs a string like the above to the console.

    Use the problem-solving framework: Understand the problem and break it up into sub-problems!

    TEST DATA 1: [17,21,23]
    TEST DATA 2: [12,5,-5,0,4]
